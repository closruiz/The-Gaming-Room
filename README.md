# The-Gaming-Room


Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was The Gaming Room. They currently had a game called Draw It or Lost It for Android. The Gaming Room wanted to improve the software functionality and to expand this game onto other platforms. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe my main contribution while developing this documentation was within my recommendations section for The Gaming Room. Pleading the case for the recommended operating system for which the company can start and expand from while trying to expand to all platforms.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It really helps on keeping the focus on the tasks that need to be conducted as well as it helps to filter on which tasks are important to prioritize. The evaluation helped highlight the differences between operating platforms and the domain model gave a visual to how the game is structured and helps as a tool when duplicating that to other platforms.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?


I would go back and improve the evaluation section, knowing that I am still learning all the operating platforms it can always be improved especially when I continue to learn more and more of the differences between them.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It is important to consider the user’s needs because ultimately, they are the ones that will be using and experiencing it. When it comes to the overall interaction it is important to deliver a product that users will want to use. 


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Started with the overall design of the game, how it functioned and what the concept was. This led to the focus on UML design and how that would transfer to other operating systems. Making sure that all the documentation and code was clear and organized.
